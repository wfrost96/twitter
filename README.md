<h1>Twitter</h1>
<p>Programmes making use of the Twitter API. Mostly in Python, although some PHP for UI.</p>

<h2>scrape_big.py</h2>
<p>When scraping Tweets from a given user's timeline, Twitter has an initial limit of 200 per go. However, you can get round this and use the full allocation of 3,200 by using the max_id parameter.<p>
<p>I've kept things small in the file, and left in a lot of "prints" so you can see your working, as it were. Change the counts to a maximum of 200, and the range to a maximum of 3,000/200.</p>
<p>Code free to a good home!</p>
